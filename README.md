#Approach
##Fizzbuzz advanced
This problem was talked about in class so I had a pretty good idea where to start. I wanted to have a CSV file that would load with the values and the stings they would be replaced by. After getting that set up, it was simply a matter of iterating through to get the desired result.

##Fizzbuzz (original)
Write a method that takes one number as an argument. For multiples of three return “Fizz”, and for the multiples of five return “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”, and in all other cases return the number.
